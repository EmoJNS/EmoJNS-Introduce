# EmoJNS-Introduce

EmoJNS is a community-led, interesting Starknet DID+SoialFi project. Just like our project's LOGO, dogeshit.stark, it is funny, the project has a strong meme attribute. Users can socialize by customizing EMOJI and personal pages ( or business cards), and then we will bind the user's address on the chain to build an DID system. In the future, we will also develop instant messaging functions to enrich the gameplay.

This is our deck and it includes three main aspects.

## Roadmap
The roadmap is divided into four parts. First, we will open domain registration on the starknet test network. The front-end is basically completed and the contract is under development. I expect that the testnet will be completed in mid-October. Next, in December, we will develop a DID system that allows users to create a personal page, bind their own social media as an on-chain business card. Then, next year, we will develop an IM chat system to make it more convenient for users to socialize, chat and make friends on starknet. Finally, we will develop EMOJI culture, which allows users to create themselves and project parties to create their own logo EMOJI.

## Team
Our team currently have five members and two technical staff. Among them, Ethan is a full-stack developer, and another will assist Luki in front-end and contrac. Maxlion is our advisor.
Ethan participated in the Chainlink & ETH Shanghai & ETH Beijing & AWS Hackathons and won three champion. He has very strong coding skills and is currently developing EmoJNS full-time.
I(Stanley) used to make primary market investments in an investment company, mainly focusing on defi and nftfi. Currently responsible for the BD and operations of EmoJNS full time.
Maxlion is the co-founder of StarknetAstro and is very familiar with the Starknet ecosystem. He is mainly responsible for some public relations in our team.

## Competitor
ENS, the name service of Ethereum, supports EMOJIs, but the number of registrations is not very large, and it is only a single on-chain label, and there are no interesting gameplays and communities.

StarknetID is the largest domain name service on starknet, but unfortunately it does not support EMOJI domain names. The existence of our project can fill this gap and improve the starknet ecosystem.

Yat is a web2 EMOJI name service. You can register a domain name such as happy angry.y.at. This domain name can display your personal homepage, similar to linktree.

Therefore, first of all, These three projects are all excellent and have a lot to learn from. However, after a horizontal analysis, our products still have some advantages. For example, we have the support of our own community. Secondly, we are not just a DID, but also a social tool. Finally, all our data is stored on the Starknet chain, compare with yat, which is more decentralized.
